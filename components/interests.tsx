            I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between academics, athletics, and creative pursuits. Drawing and
            playing guitar provide me with outlets for self-expression and help me approach challenges with fresh
            perspectives. Music, in particular, has taught me about rhythm, patterns, and the beauty of diverse
            influencesâ€”lessons that apply to coding and problem-solving as well.
