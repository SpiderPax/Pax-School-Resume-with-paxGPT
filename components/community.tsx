            Community service has taught me empathy, gratitude, and the power of collective action. Whether I'm helping
            feed the homeless or maintaining public spaces, I've learned that small actions can make a big difference.

            These experiences have shaped my values and reinforced my commitment to using my skills and opportunities to
            help othersâ€”a principle I'll carry throughout my education and career.
