          <p>
            I'm currently a student at <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Central Montessori School</span> in
            Richmond, VA, where I've been learning since 2015. The Montessori approach has taught me invaluable skills
            in independent time management, self-directed learning, and collaboration.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic journey has been driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving. I completed{" "}
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Algebra I in 7th grade</span> and am currently enrolled in
            Geometry and Spanish I, maintaining a strong GPA of 3.9 in 6th grade and 3.7 in 7th grade.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond academics, I believe in giving back to my community and staying active. Whether I'm on the soccer
            field, in the pool, or volunteering to help those in need, I strive to make a positive impact wherever I go.
